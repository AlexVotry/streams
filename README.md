I wanted to explore how redux-form works. It has built-in action creators and reducers, so understanding how redux works is essential.  We just add the formReducer from redux-form into our list of reducers. 

Essentially, the redux-form will manage all our input data from forms in the redux store.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
